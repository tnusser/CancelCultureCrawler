# Twitter provides some internal Named Entity Recognition (NER) and thus provides so called context annotations to the
# tweets. They bloat the response and often double the size of it. Twitter restricts the maximum amount of individual
# tweets in one response if those context annotations are present. NOTE: Crawling time = 5*n if set to true
# If NamedEntityRecognition = true  max_result = 100
# If NamedEntityRecognition = false max_result = 500

# The crawler allows to search for hashtags and mentions of users. Those hashtags or mentions do not have to be the head
# of the conversation tree and might occur somewhere in-between.
# CompleteTree = true will crawl the whole conversation tree, with parents and children.
# CompleteTree = false will only crawl the children of this specific tweet inside the conversation tree.
# Note: Popular hashtags or users could be mentioned by bots on potentially huge tweets with large amount of replies
# for marketing their own posts. Can increase crawl duration substantially
